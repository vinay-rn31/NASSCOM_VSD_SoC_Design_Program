* CORE- The logical cells occupies the complete area of the core
* DIE-A die which consists of core, is small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.
* Utilization factor = Area Occupied by Netlist/Total Area of the core
* Aspect Ratio= Height/Width

#### Pre-placed cells

The arrangement of these IP's in a chip is referred as Floorplanning,These IP's/blocks have user-defined locations, and hence are placed in chip before automated placement-and-routing and are called as pre-placed cells.
#### De-coupling Capacitors
